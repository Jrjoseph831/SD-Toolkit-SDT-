### Introduction to Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a cybersecurity paradigm centered around the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters. Instead, they must verify anything and everything trying to connect to its systems before granting access.

### Key Concepts of Zero Trust
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimize each user's exposure to sensitive parts of the network.
- **Micro-Segmentation**: Create secure zones in networks to isolate network segments from each other and secure them individually.
- **Continuous Monitoring and Verification**: Continuously validate that trust through dynamic and adaptive policies.
